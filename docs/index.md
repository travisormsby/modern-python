# Introduction

Python is over 35 years old, but there are ongoing significant changes in the ecosystem that affect best practices for writing Pythonic code. This workshop highlights a few of the most impactful changes from the past several years that you should get you rethinking your code:

- [Manage environments](manage-environments.md) with `uv` and `pixi`.
- [Create dynamic text](create-dynamic-text.md) with f- and t-strings.
- [Manipulate filepaths](manipulate-filepaths.md) with `Pathlib`.
- [Structure data](structure-data.md) with Dataclasses and Pydantic models.
- [Encode complex conditional logic](encode-complex-conditional-logic.md) with structural pattern matching.
- [Improve code legibility](improve-code-legibility.md) with type annotations.
- [Upgrade Python](upgrade-python.md) to take advantage of significant performance improvements
